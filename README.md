MT-EQuAl
========

MT-EQuAl (Machine Translation Error Quality Alignment) is a toolkit for the manual assessment of Machine Translation (MT) output. MT-EQuAl implements three different tasks in an integrated environment: annotation of translation errors, translation quality rating (e.g. adequacy and fluency, relative ranking of alternative translations), and word alignment. The toolkit is web-based and multi-user, allowing large scale and remotely managed annotation projects. It incorporates a number of project management functions and sophisticated progress monitoring capabilities. The implemented tasks are configurable and can be adapted to several specific annotation needs. The toolkit is open source and released under Apache 2.0 license.
