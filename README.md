MT-EQuAl
========

a Toolkit for Manual Assessment of Machine Translation Output

MT-EQuAl (Machine Translation Error Quality Alignment) is a toolkit for the manual assess- ment of Machine Translation (MT) output. MT-EQuAl implements three different tasks in an integrated environment: annotation of translation errors, translation quality rating (e.g. ade- quacy and fluency, relative ranking of alternative translations), and word alignment. The toolkit is web-based and multi-user, allowing large scale and remotely managed annotation projects. It incorporates a number of project management functions and sophisticated progress monitor- ing capabilities. The implemented tasks are configurable and can be adapted to several specific annotation needs. The toolkit is open source and released under Apache 2.0 license.
