OVERVIEW:
-------------

The annotation interface is created to carry out three annotation tasks, namely:
− Task 1: Assessing automatic translation quality.
− Task 2: Identification of errors in the automatic translations.
− Task 2: Word alignment in the automatic translations.

For more details about the task see the documentation on docs/ directory.

To work with the interface, you must use one of the supported browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox.

All code is available at: https://github.com/hltfbk/MT-EQuAl	


INSTALLATION:
---------------

- Step 1: Install Apache
Apache is a free open source software which runs over 50% of the world’s web servers.

To install apache, open terminal and type in these commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install apache2

That’s it. To check if Apache is installed, direct your browser to http://localhost/ and the page should display the words “It works!".

- Step 2: Install MySQL
MySQL is a powerful database management system used for organizing and retrieving data 

To install MySQL, open terminal and type in these commands:
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql

During the installation, MySQL will ask you to set a root password. If you miss the chance to set the password while the program is installing, it is very easy to set the password later from within the MySQL shell.

Once you have installed MySQL, we should activate it with this command:
$ sudo mysql_install_db

Finish up by running the MySQL set up script:
$ sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

The prompt will ask you for your current root password. Type it in.
Then the prompt will ask you if you want to change the root password. Go ahead and choose N and move on to the next steps. 

It’s easiest just to say Yes to all the options. At the end, MySQL will reload and implement the new changes.

- Step 3: Install PHP
PHP is an open source web scripting language that is widely use to build dynamic webpages. 

To install PHP, open terminal and type in this command:
$ sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt

After you answer yes to the prompt twice, PHP will install itself.

It may also be useful to add php to the directory index, to serve the relevant php index files:
$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf

Add index.php to the beginning of index files. The page should now look like this:
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
       DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.php index.xhtml index.htm
</IfModule>

Install the MySQL module for php5, type:
$ sudo apt-get install php5-mysql

- Step 4: deploy MT-EQuAl code
Unzip MT-EQuAl-1.0.zip or clone the Github repository in your Apache document root directory (for example /www/html/).
Edit the file initdb.conf and change the value of DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD according your MySQL installation.

If your web server is configured correctly, you should now find your MT-EQuAl application accessible at http://localhost/mtequal/.

Congratulations! You now have MT-EQuAl stack on your machine!


DATABASE SETUP:
--------------------------

- Create an empty MT-EQuAl database
You will need the init_mtequal.db file located in the data/ directory and following these command:
$ mysqladmin -u root -p<PASSWORD> create mtequal
$ mysql -u root -p<PASSWORD> mtequal < data/init_mtequal.db
 
In the same way it is possible to restore a previous dump of the database following these command:
$ mysql -u root -p<PASSWORD> mtequal < data/dump/FILE.sql


INPUT FILE FORMAT:
-------------------
The page admin.php allows to upload the sentences for a specific task. The format of this file must contain a three columns per line divided by a tabular space:
- sentence ID;
- language (en, ar, it, zh,...);
- the sentence (using UTF8 encoding).

See some examples in the directory data/input/.
